# Numerical-Methods-implementation-in-MATLAB

Various Numerical Methods have been implemented using MATLAB. They help in analysis of linear and non-linear mathematical functions. They are listed as follows:

a) Cramer's Rule
b) Bisection Method
c) Gauss Seidel Method
d) Gauss Elimination Method
e) Gauss Jordan Method
f) Jacobi's Matrix Method
g) L-U Decomposition Method
h) Gauss Elimination with Partial Pivoting
i) Regula Falsi Iterative Method

Outputs of the same have also been attached.
